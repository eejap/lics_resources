# lics_help

A set of instructions in text files and commands in shell scripts to assist LiCS interferogram and time-series processing.

Scripts are organised as follows:

1. framebatch = scripts and pointers to create interferograms that fill gaps in LiCS interferogram networks
2. lics_check = scripts to manage LiCS Check outputs
3. licsbas = scripts and instructions for batch processing and modifying network plots

The main instructions and guidance for any LiCS processing can be found on the COMET LiCSAR github: https://comet-licsar.github.io/index.html#

For further guidance see the old COMET LiCS wiki page: https://gitlab.com/comet_licsar/licsar_documentation/-/wikis/home

Most of these scripts are created originally by Andrew Watson (andwatson) and/or Milan Lazecky (espiritocz).
Instructions compiled by Jess Payne (eejap) in 2023.
