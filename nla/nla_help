Sometimes NLA requests do not run, maybe because you have reached your NLA quote. Follow below to deal with it.

1. Maybe you see after running LiCSAR_0_getFiles.py that the request was not created:
Request was not created... Please check manually for label 050D_04647_121313: 2015-02-18 -> 2019-07-03
...this can mean you have exceeded your NLA quota.

2. To check this, run:
nla.py requests
...this prints your quote size and the total request size you have currently taken up.
...for me I was using 90%+ of my quota so need to delete requests I have used.

3) Run:
nla.py
...to see documentation for this command and enter interactive nla coding environment.

4) Run:
expire $ID
...where $ID is the nla request number you have finished with- maybe you have finished gapfilling or have now
downloaded the SLCs so you don't need to keep them on NLA storage anymore.
...this expire command makes that nla request expiry date now so that the request is removed from your storage.
...your quote should be not as full :)
...n.b. nla requests expire automatically after a few days! make sure to use files you request before this time
