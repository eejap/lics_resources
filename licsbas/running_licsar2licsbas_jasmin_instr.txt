### Running licsar2licsbas.sh on JASMIN

licsar2licsbas is a tool run by Milan Lazecky. More information about this tool is available here: https://comet-licsar.github.io/licsar_proc/index.html#licsar-to-licsbas-jasmin

The tool performs two things:
a. Interferogram 'reunwrapping'
b. Time-series analysis using LiCSBAS

Step a (reunwrapping) needs to be turned on using flag -u (see below). Time-sereis analysis b is always done.

You might want to do reunwrapping if you have:
1. High number of loop errors
2. Unwrapping errors in some or many interferograms
3. High phase gradients
4. Low velocity coverage due to maskin (potentially due to high loop errors)

### Instructions
1) Before you can process on JASMIN, you'll need an account and permissions. A guide for
acquiring these can be found at:
https://gitlab.com/comet_licsar/licsar_documentation/-/wikis/home

2) You will also need to be a member of:
comet_lics (group workspace)
nceo_geohazards (group workspace)
nceo_lics (group workspace)
hpxfer (additional service)
... on JASMIN

3) Familiarise yourself with the slurm processing system:
https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/category/4889-slurm

4) Set up JASMIN fingerprints etc. Would recommend doing this on holly or other server rather than locally.
Log into JASMIN via:
a) exec ssh-agent $SHELL
b) ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_jasmin
c) ssh -X -A eejap002@login1.jasmin.ac.uk

5) Log into a sci server. Avoid 3 and 6, e.g.:
ssh -X -A eejap002@sci.jasmin.ac.uk

6) Add to your ~/.bashrc file the line:
module use "/gws/smf/j04/nceo_geohazards/software/Modules/"
...then source your bashrc file so that you can access the licsar modules.

7) Get LiCS commands up and running via:
a) module load licsar_framebatch_testing
b) source /gws/smf/j04/nceo_geohazards/software/mambalics/load_mambalics.rc
... you will now have access to licsar_framebatch codes (and many other codes created by Milan and Yasser to do all things LiCS).
... see https://comet-licsar.github.io/index.html# and https://gitlab.com/comet_licsar for more info.

8) Navigate yourself to where you want your reunwrapped interferograms to be stored, probably a scratch directory.

9) The current (May 2023) recommended processing parameters for reunwrapping involve using Cascade and Goldstein filter options.
For example to reunwrap interferograms for an area clipped to region -G at full LiCS resolution (ml1) use:
licsar2licsbas.sh -G -99.4/-98.75/19.0/19.9 -M 1 -t 0 -g -u -c -m -T -n 10 -P $frame 20141001 20230101

-G = defines area to reunwrap
-M = multilooking value
-t = threshold for coherence (Milan recommends using zero where phase gradients are high or where signal might lie in very incoherent areas, but a personal choice)
-g = use GACOS for LiCSBAS time-series analysis
-u = perform reunwrapping (i.e. do not just run time-series analysis)
-c = use cascade for reunwrapping (see Lazecky et al, 2022 for more info https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9884337)
-m = use Goldstein filter for reunwrapping. If this flag is used, a spectral magnitude measure of coherence is used.
-T = use the testing version of LiCSBAS (currently this uses --nopngs and --nullify, in future, this will also add --singular)
-n = number of cores/processes (?)
-P = use the COMET queue
$frame = your LiCS frame ID
20141001 20230101 = date range of interferograms to be found.

10) If you run this command in command line on JASMIN, a job will be submitted. Reunwrapping at ml10 for a full frame takes 6-9 hours depending on how JASMIN is behaving.

11) Outputs are similar to those written during normal LiCSBAS processing. Usefully, a netcdf (.nc) file is also output which is a bit easier to code with than the normal hdf5 (.h5) output.
