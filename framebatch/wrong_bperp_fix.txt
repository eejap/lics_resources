Workflow to fix erroneous bperp values in LiCS network plots:

***be careful not to overwrite baselines text file without making a copy first***

1. Go to $LiCSAR_public/../$frame/metadata

2. Make copy of baselines txt file to preserve original baseline data

3. Remove erroneous epoch(s) from baselines file

4. Run e.g.:
plot_network.py $LiCSAR_public/174/174A_05798_131313 network.png gaps.txt
...to pull baseline values from ASF

5. "baselines" will now contain those downloaded from ASF. It's likely some will be
"not found on ASF", so take the output of regenerated baselines file for only the
erroneous (now not erroneous) epoch(s) and add to the copied baselines text file. Delete
the regenerated baselines and rename the copied baselines with the now correct bperp
to "baselines".

6. Run plot_network.py `pwd` metadata/network.png metadata/gaps.txt in
$LiCSAR_public/../$frame to plot a new network plot with the correct bperp! The new network
will automatically be on the portal.
